The Github repository and Github page for my personal portfolio website showcase my various projects, including a Netflix clone, weather app, and music genre classification. Additionally, it displays my mini projects and personal information. The repository includes the source code, documentation, and live demos of the projects. The portfolio website aims to highlight my skills, experience, and personal interests to potential employers or collaborators.
